# ReactiveCore

**ReactiveCore** is a lightweight reactive state system for Unity. It offers a simple `ReactiveValue<T>` class that allows for clean, safe value subscriptions and automatic lifecycle handling.

## Features

- Type-safe reactive values
- Auto-disposal of subscriptions
- Lightweight and dependency-free
- Great for decoupling UI and logic

## Installation

1. Add this package via Unity Package Manager by Git URL: https://github.com/toblerus/reactivecore.git

Or install the `ReactiveCore-vx.xx.x.unitypackage`

## Usage
### Subscribe
```
public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    private ReactiveValue<int> health = new ReactiveValue<int>(100);
    private IDisposable subscription;

    void Start()
    {
        subscription = health.Subscribe(OnHealthChanged);
        health.Value = 75;
    }

    void OnDestroy()
    {
        subscription.Dispose();
    }

    void OnHealthChanged(int newHealth)
    {
        Debug.Log("Health is now: " + newHealth);
